# Recording 3CX CDRs in a PostgreSQL Database with Grafana

## Description

This tool facilitates the recording of 3CX Call Detail Records (CDRs) in a PostgreSQL database and the creation of dashboards with Grafana.

It allows you to collect call data from your 3CX telephony system and store it in a PostgreSQL database. With Grafana, you can then visualize this data in the form of interactive and customizable dashboards.

## Main Features

- **CDR Collection**: Retrieval of CDRs from 3CX via different transfer modes (TCP, FTP, SFTP, SCP).
- **Integration of 3CX Information**: Extensions and queues can be integrated into the database via the available web interface to allow more detailed analysis of CDRs.
- **Storage in PostgreSQL**: Recording of CDRs in a PostgreSQL database for centralized and structured storage.
- **Web API**: A Web API is provided to interact with the stored CDR data.
- **Visualization with Grafana**: Creation of Grafana dashboards to visualize and analyze call data interactively.
- **Event Management**: Manage events with recurrence rules, impact levels, and associations with extensions and queues.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates using WebSocket for event management.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- FastAPI (Web API)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Grafana (Data Visualization)
- Docker (Containerization)
- NiceGUI (Frontend)
- WebSockets (Real-time updates)
