    The `sftpclient` class provides a convenient way to interact with an SFTP server. It allows you to:
    
    - Connect to an SFTP server with the provided host, user, password, and optional port, private key, and private key password.
    - Monitor an SFTP folder, download any new files to a local folder, and optionally archive or delete the files on the SFTP server.
    - Read any CSV files that were downloaded to the local folder and move them to an archive folder.
    
    The `monitor` method is the main entry point for interacting with the SFTP server. It will connect to the SFTP server, change to the specified `ftpfolder`, download any new files to the `localfolder`, and then either archive or delete the files on the SFTP server based on the value of the `FTP_3CX_ARCHIVE_OR_DELETE` environment variable. Finally, it will read any CSV files that were downloaded and move them to the `archivefolder`.
